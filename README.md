# Sovereign-Language-Intent-Grammar

Candidate: Tanvi Waykar  
Product: Sovereign Language  

## Overview
This repository contains submissions for Task 01, Task 02, and Task 03,
focused on intent grammar modeling, authority, time evaluation,
refusal logic, and semantic equivalence across programming languages.

No executable code is included, as the task focuses on semantic
preservation rather than implementation.

## Contents
- Task 01: Intent decomposition and refusal modeling
- Task 02: Authority, time windows, state drift, conflict, irreversibility
- Task 03: Semantic binding of the same intent grammar across Python,
  JavaScript, and declarative representations, with semantic drift analysis

## Notes
All representations are read-only and preserve the original
intent structure without modification, as required by the task.
